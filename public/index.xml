      <description>Nice to meet you! :)
Hi guys! Pengbo here;) I am currently an M.Eng. student at Cornell, and my concentration is Financial Engineering in the department of Operation Research and Information Engineering. In my spare time, I love to explore different trails of Ithaca, and I enjoy hiking and lots of other outdoor activities as well!</description>

      <description>Being a finance major student as an undergraduate, I did not do many projects on github. But here I would like to show some of my internship experiences to let you know me more.
By the end of this semester, I would also be joining UBS for my summer internship as a quantitative trading analyst, where I could utilize the quantitative skills and technical mindsets to solve real-world financial problems! ;)</description>
