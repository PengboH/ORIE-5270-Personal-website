Nice to meet you! :) 

Hi guys! Pengbo here;) I am currently an M.Eng. student at Cornell, and my concentration is Financial Engineering in the department of Operation Research and Information Engineering. In my spare time, I love to explore different trails of Ithaca, and I enjoy hiking and lots of other outdoor activities as well!
