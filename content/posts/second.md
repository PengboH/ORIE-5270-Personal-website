Being a finance major student as an undergraduate, I did not do many projects on github. But here I would like to show some of my internship experiences to let you know me more.

By the end of this semester, I would also be joining UBS for my summer internship as a quantitative trading analyst, where I could utilize the quantitative skills and technical mindsets to solve real-world financial problems! ;)
